I built a Django-based web application that focuses on secure user authentication and blog management. 
The system includes registration, login, logout, role-based access, and password reset via email.

Authentication Explanation:
I used Django’s built-in authentication system to securely manage users. 
Passwords are hashed automatically, and sessions are handled by Django, ensuring security best practices.

User Roles:
There are two roles: admin and regular users. Admins have full access through Django admin, 
while regular users can only manage their own blog posts.

Password Reset Feature (Important!):
I implemented password reset functionality using Django’s built-in password reset views. 
When a user forgets their password, a secure token-based link is sent via email using Mailtrap. 
The user can reset their password and is redirected back to login.

UI & Design:
I created a consistent card-based UI using custom CSS so all authentication and dashboard pages have the same look and feel.

Challenges Faced:
The main challenge was correctly configuring email-based password reset and handling Django URL/view flow, 
which helped me understand Django authentication deeply.
